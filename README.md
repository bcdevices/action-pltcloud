# PLTcloud Action 

The PLTcloud action allows publishing firmware releases directly
to [BCD](https://www.bcdevices.com/)'s [PLTcloud](https://www.bcdevices.com/plt/) backend.
It allows you to upload a release to PLTcloud as part of your CI workflow.

## Input variables

You must provide:

  - `API_TOKEN`: PLTcloud API token.
  - `PROJECT_UUID`: Project id for PLTcloud project.
  - `FILES`: List of files for upload. Files can be specified with patterns such as: `**/prefix*`, `grandparent/**/child?`, `**/parent/*`, or even just `**`
  - `VERSION`: Release version

## Usage

Step 1: Validate firmware build and test plans
==============================================

In order to upload a release, the PLT test plan, and any associated assets
such as DUT firmware must be available in a directory.

Setup a GitHub action to build the firmware and copy test plans
to a known directory.

Step 2: Configure project and token secrets
===========================================

- Log in to PLTcloud and select the `Project` menu item from the
  project drop-down in the top banner.
- Copy the ``UUID`` from the project detail page and a secret named
  ``PROJECT_UUID`` in your GitHub project.
- Select ``API Tokens`` from the drop-down menu under the user menu in PLTcloud
- Select ``Add Release Token``, login and copy the ``Release Upload Token``
- Add the release token to GitHub secrets and name it ``API_TOKEN``

Step 3: Add the PLTcloud action to the GitHub Actions Workflow
==============================================================

Add a step in the ``.github/workflows/main.yml`` actions workflow,
after the steps that build the firmware:

```yml
- uses: .github/actions/action-pltcloud 
  with:
    FILES: dist/*
    API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
    PROJECT_UUID: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_UUID }}
    VERSION: ${GITHUB_REF:10}
```
